This project is an interactive Smart City Dashboard built in Power BI, focusing on air quality analysis across Indian cities.
It combines multiple datasets to provide insights into AQI levels, pollutant trends, city comparisons, and health impacts.
The goal is to support urban planning and policy-making by providing a data-driven view of pollution patterns in Indian cities.

🗂️ Datasets Used

The project integrates multiple Excel/CSV files:

city_day.csv → Daily AQI and pollutants at the city level
station_day.csv → Daily AQI and pollutants at the station level
stations.csv → Mapping of cities to monitoring stations
